# SimpleOfflineCache

This app demonstrates a very basic simple offline caching strategy. In android one can obtain data in form of JSON and then store it into a local database. This is turn lets an user
interact with the app even if the user is offline, also no progress barðŸ¥³. But saving up everything into the database would end up using huge amount of data, which we dont want. So,
one must delete the previously cached up data, when saving new data.

This is a very simple caching strategy, which is demonstrated here.
